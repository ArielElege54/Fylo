## My process

Started from the html, moved on to css. I already have front-end experience, so it was fairly easy and fairly challenging, I attempted the styling from top to bottom, then onto the media queries for mobile view, I didn't any use animations nor js. There really isn't much to say.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the power of transform, it was integral for the footer nudge that the signup form causes.

Here's the whole styling:

```css
.signup {
	background: hsl(217, 28%, 15%);
	width: fit-content;
	padding: 0 2rem 2rem 2rem;
	margin: 2rem;
	border-radius: 0.2rem;
	box-shadow: 0.2rem 0.2rem 8px hsl(0, 0%, 0%, 0.7);
	transform: translateY(6rem);
}
```

### Continued development

I'm still not fully versed with grid layouts; I hope to work on that in the near future.

### Useful resources

I use youtube for most of my research
